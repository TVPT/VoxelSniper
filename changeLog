I would like to start a sort of changeLog to track changes done to VoxelSniper
[newversion] -- change
[] --


[4.675] -- begin of changeLog
[4.676] -- created FillDown.java
[4.677] -- debugging FillDown.java
[4.678] -- stupid newb errorz
[4.679] -- wtf? why this no work
[4.680] -- trying to fix it again
[4.681] -- FillDown.java works, yay
[4.682] -- Moved items.txt to plugins/VoxelSniper and forced /items.txt
            to be removed if plugins/VoxelSniper/items.txt is not present
            Added code to prevent liteSnipers from using multiple commands
            addlitesniper | addsniper | removesniper | goto |
            vs lightning / weather / range
[4.683] -- Fixed weird stuff in Ball.java
[4.684] -- Created Set.java
[4.685] -- Forgot an "=" sign in Set.java
[4.686] -- Added the green record as a sneak item - left click crouch returns previous brush, right click crouch returns two brushes back.  -Gavjenks
[4.687] -- Overlay will skip any air blocks when filling in downward, so as not to fill in caves with weird stalactites. -Gavjenks
[4.688] -- /bms [#] will save current brush into a hashmap with that integer key.  /bml [#] loads that preset.  Can thus create a whole palette of brushes for a particular job, and switch very quickly.  Also allows possibility of having hardcoded sets of presets for certain kinds of jobs.  Also: add functionality to allow people to input a string instead of an integer.
[4.689] -- fixing various errors with the above. -Gavjenks
[4.690] -- can now use strings for the presets as well as integers.  more user friendly.  Also saves all your brush size settings, etc. in the preset.  Desired for future: save in a text file or something on the server to survive reloads.
[4.691] -- added parameter memory to the /b and green vinyl record methods, too.  They will maintain the brush sizes and other things you had with your last brush.  Whenever you declare a new brush, or do /d, or save a preset, it saves all your parameters (in the case of declaring a new brush, it will save them as the parameters for the previous brush.  /d saves your old under previous, and then saves the defaults under current.  Presets save in current.).
[4.692] -- Changed /b si to /b is, and /b sip to /b isp.   Ink needs to always be in the same place in the syntax, so you don't have to individually remember every acronym.  -Gavjenks
[4.693] -- Added SplatterOverlay brush
[4.694] -- Added BlendVoxelDisc brush
[4.695] -- Added option to exclude air from BlendVoxelDisc
[4.698] -- Efficiency and visual smoothness tweaks to BlendVoxelDisc
[4.699] -- Added BlendVoxel brush
[4.700] -- Added BlendDisc and BlendBall brushes
[4.701] -- Gave all blend brushes the ability to exclude water
[4.702] -- Added Line brush
[4.703] -- Overlay should entirely ignore water in all cases now.  Bugfix.  Gavjenks
[4.704] -- Overlay no longer ignores single deep blocks.  That turned out I think to hurt more than it helped.  Gavjenks
[4.705] -- Introduced VoxelFood, I call the Catapult Cafe Calzone!  prz
[4.706] -- Damn Config version Check. aka. BugFix.  prz
[4.707] -- Added SnowCone brush - Giltwist

[4.719] -- Added Blend, Line and Overlay brushes to LiteSniper. - plusnine
[4.720] -- Got rid of debugging stuff in Vsniper.  /bms and /bml should work now for saving and loading brush and parameter presets (will get wiped with a reload currently.)  Green record is broken still -GJ
[4.721] -- Erode brush gunpowder much more usefully flips all your fill vs. erode parameters to do the opposite thing at the same intensity, rather than just changing order of calculation -GJ
[4.722] -- Added gavinsecret brush.  Only a "secret" to non developers... It is a brush to generate massively complex 3d mazes automatically and paint them right into minecraft.  It's purpose is hidden and it is password protected to avoid people knowing what it is from the brush list and nagging me and/or making tons of stupid mazes everywhere.  Just meant for personal or approved use on a project impossible to do by hand -GJ
[4.723] -- Fixed directional biases in line brush.  Count on Notch to make the X axis calculate differently than Y and Z.  Also fixed some rounding errors -Giltwist
[4.724] -- OMG, really Notch?! Every quadrant needs a different offset? Rar.  Line brush REALLY fixed now. -Giltwist
[4.725] -- Updated items.txt generation code for 1.6 - Giltwist
[4.726] -- Added Meteor Brush - Giltwist

[4.735] -- ink ball replace specific brush -GJ
[4.736] -- Made right click crouch with dooplicator do a /d reset at feather's request.  -GJ
[4.737] -- Trying to fix green record and brush preset slots so they save parameters correctly ... again -GJ
[4.738] -- Made force brush use /b instead of its own dumb radius parameter, and fixed some problems with antifreeze brush hopefully (blankets ice with invisible stairs then melts it to stop reforming)
[4.739] -- Work on Maze brush, fixed some infos and things.  -GJ
[4.740] -- Antifreeze brush now works great and ready to use on server.  -GJ
[4.741] -- Maze brush first draft done. -GJ
[4.742] -- Adding generation for new tree types. -Ghost
[4.743] -- Created Sit brush - prz
[4.744] -- Chunk coordinates brush for debugging other things - Gav
[4.745] -- Added powder fucntion to ib and ibr to just make (or replace) balls of that type and id.  So /ib /v 35 /vi 14, powder, will make a ball of red wool.  Arrow acts normally.  -Gav
[4.746] -- added ink blob brush - Gav
[4.747] -- added strong ink blob brush - Gav
[4.748] -- added blob replace brush - Gav
[4.749] -- added new blocktypes for Patch 1.7 (29, 33, 34) -plusnine
[4.750] -- added precision ink ball replace, which sahould be able to handle any redstone or piston shenanigans you want.  full control of replace v and vi and set v and vi.  -Gavjenks.
(I will also make a spreadsheet for choosing which brush you need soon).
[4.751] -- added Eraser brush - Giltwist
[4.752] -- testing -prz
[4.753] -- stupid people spoonfeed changes -prz
[4.754] -- Added info and info2 parameters to GT brush - Giltwist

[5.007] -- Changed all set/s performers to material/m performers to prevent confusion with the snipe/s brush - Giltwist
[5.008] -- After discussion with Gavjenks, began conversion to MIC performer naming framework - Giltwist
[5.009] -- Added several more performers. Much easier to see what's missing with MIC system - Giltwist
[5.010] -- Old code - new code fix for Ocean.java
[5.011] -- Added some more no-physics performers.  Proposed change to sneak.java in comments - Giltwist

[5.023] -- Typo'ish thing -przerwap
[5.024] -- More bugfix -przerwap
[5.025] -- Derping -przerwap
[5.026] -- EntityRemoval.java -przerwap
[5.027] -- Derp
[5.028] -- Added pExcludeMat -psanker
[5.029] -- /ve command -przerwap
[5.030] -- Typo -przerwap
[5.031] -- Bugfixes with pExcludeMat and /ve (not allowing removal)
[5.032] -- None of the voxel brushes worked for people, cause the for loops were going from -bsize and then subtracting to even more negative.  Fixed them, but I don't know how to update to the server, so it's not there yet.  -Gav
[5.033] -- Still moar bugfixes for the exclusion performer and command -psanker
[5.034] -- added preliminary 1.8 blocktype IDs and friendly-names. - plusnine
[5.035] -- Added pNoUndo, fixed /ve -psanker
[5.036] -- Made snipe brush capable of /u as per forum request - Giltwist
[5.037] -- Renamed NoUndo to MatNoUndo and added InkNoUndo and ComboNoUndo.  Do we need replace versions? No physics? - Giltwist // No. This is for bombing structures, like in Quercas (for helper snipers / titans / admins). Peter also wasn't sure that he wanted ink and combos, but ok (psanker)
[5.038] -- Revert to NoUndo (przerwap); added new Spline brush and spline engine for future use; *CRITICAL UPDATE*: Added a Y-bounds check on ALL performers (notch has dumb code where if a block update happens < 0, it gets mirrored to 128 and on down); Added a disc mode to Drain; Added CleanSnow -psanker
[5.039] -- rewrote undo - przerwap
[5.040] -- typo - przerwap
[5.041] -- sign+noteblock stuff - przerwap
[5.042] -- ironing out stuff (null checks) - przerwap
[5.043] -- fixes to CleanSnow -psa
[5.044] -- Rewrote sankers' Exclusion stuff - przerwap // thx -psa
[5.045] -- Forgot a line of code in EntityRemoval.java - przerwap
[5.046] -- nullchecks /u - przerwap
[5.047] -- Added pIncludeMat (uses /vn or /vin) -psa  --> LOL sanker, why did you copy pasta the ExclusionList class to a new name? lol -przerwap I was lazy and didn't rename ExclusionList
[5.048] -- Added Extrude brush (as per request of Featherblade) -psa
[5.049] -- derp herp -prz
[5.050] -- ??? & extrude code fix -psa
[5.051] -- extrude overhaul and removal of /vn and rename /ve to /vl for a generic voxel list to act upon (from a request of Featherblade) -psa
            --> FB doesn't know what he is talking about, ask Gilt for his opinion but I will tell you that I wouldn't want to clear my list every time I wanted to go from exclusion to inclusion -prz
[5.052] -- Added the feature that when crouching and left or right clicking with arrow at the sky or void or edge of render, it will set your /v or /vr to 0, respectively.  I also changed the message from "invalid target" to "You clicked the sky or void" so that people doing this would not feel like it was an error when sneaking, but people getting it normally would still understand what they did wrong.  Would be more elegant by adding an argument to getTarget() for true/false on the error message entirely, but I assumed you wouldn't want me to be changing the argument structures in Brush.java...  -gav
[5.053] -- Added /vs printout command, toggles back and forth whether the game chat spams you with less important things like voxel and replace and data values, etc.  Still will always printout performer, brush, and size. -Gav
[5.054] -- Copy Pasta will bite you guys in the ass someday :P  vMessages printout toggle was printing out /vs lightning status -prz  (also going to restructure some stuff to fit the idea above. But am going to modify the above idea to my view. -prz
[5.055] -- Done as promised. Needs testing ... Uploading to server -prz
[5.056] -- The set___() in vSniper.java prinited the apropriate vMessage.__() so duplicate vMessage.__()'s in Sneak printed stuff out duplicate, so I removed them -prz
[5.057] -- Added Ring.java aka Ring brush /b ri (ir#.#(innerRadius))
[5.058] -- Derp code -przerwap
[5.059] -- Added SetRedstoneFlip brush.
[5.060] -- Added hardcoded limit to Set brush (set to 5,000,000)
[5.061] -- Added ReverseOverlay brush heavy debugging follows - jmck95
[5.062] -- Fixed crashing bug with ReverseOverlay brush - jmck95
[5.063] -- Added new timer for VoxelFood in VoxelSniperListener.java - Razorcane
[5.064] -- Fixed derp code in DietDrSmurfy.java and added new features. - Razorcane
[5.065] -- Added CopyPasta brush, fixed some derp in Line and Triangle brushes that might cause cross-world messes. -Giltwist
[5.066] -- Had some variable name derps in CopyPasta -Giltwist
[5.067] -- OK, I think I've got all the counters and offsets all fixed now on CopyPasta -- Giltwist
[5.068] -- tweaked offset, should be better now -- Giltwist
[5.069] -- adjusted ReverseOverlay to give gunpowder functionallity. -jmck95
[5.070] -- Added pivot brush, 180 degree only for now -- Giltwist
[5.071] -- Testing 270 on pivot -- Giltwist

[5.074] -- Made generateChunk.java actually do something.. -prz
[5.075] -- Fixed the /vs s command. - Razorcane
[5.076] -- Added SignEdit.java, still a heavy WIP. - Razorcane
[5.077] -- adjusted code in underlay brush. --jmck95
[5.078] -- removed depth affecting If statement - jmck95
[5.079] -- changed some code in Set.java - prz
[5.080] -- fixed Set.java -- prz  Also, I will treat the person that keeps deleting my changelog version stubs with pain.
[5.081] -- adjusted underlay brush filling -jmck95
[5.082] -- fixed underlay brush bug -- jmck95
[5.083] -- fixed underlay brush arrow breaking bug -- jmck95
[5.084] -- repasted and cleaned underlay brush code -- jmck95
[5.085] -- either the underlay brush is gonna work this time or im gonna hurt someone -- jmck95
[5.086] -- Changed annoying messages in Triangle.java and edited CopyPasta.java. - Razorcane
[5.087] -- Added Vegetation. Never tested. commented out on vBrushes. -geekygenius
[5.088] -- Added Fertilize. Tested several times.-geekygenius
[5.089] -- Merged pivot into CopyPasta, removed the accidentally restored defunct brushes -Giltwist
[5.090] -- Experimental alternative to 3d rotation brush added.  -GavJenks
[5.091] -- vertical rotation brush (2d) ready and working.  Added underlay brush to litebrushes - jmck95
[5.092] -- Added multi-command functionality - prz
[5.093] -- Underlay was added to liteBrushes enum. Also first commit to SVN - prz
[5.094] -- Changed "/vupdate" to "/vchunk" for compatibility with VoxelUpdate - psa
[5.095] -- Changed the mechanics of Disc.java to fix undo problems - prz
[5.096] -- Fixed minor typo in copypasta (silly minus signs) - giltwist
[5.097] -- Updated some undo code - prz
[5.098] -- Added Comet brush for the new blaze small fireball, pw protected at Ridge's request - Giltwist
[5.099] -- Allowed OP's to /addsniper  - prz
[5.100] -- Typo - prz
[5.101] -- Added PlayerTeleportEvent to Jockey.java - prz
[5.102] -- Updated the EntityRemoval.java brush - prz
[5.103] -- Added IOPlayerManager support for VG ranks - psanker // Side note, could someone clean this log up? This is a disaster.
[5.104] -- Fixed logic of /b el fill and upped max step division to π/1000 - psa // Really should do a definite integral of (x^2 / a^2) + (y^2 / b^2) = 1 ... Makes this soo much easier
[5.105] -- Added block distance to ruler brush - Giltwist
[5.106] -- Copypasta block limit is now rank-based if VoxelGuest is installed - Giltwist
[5.107] -- Added numerous brushes to lite, basically anything brush size based and less destructive than things they had already.  Also some of the diagnostic tools (scanner, e.g.) they didn't have for some reason. -GJ
[5.108] -- Derped and forgot that ellipse is not /b based.  Removed from lite.  Also added text warnings about erode brush. Also added /vs range to lite, and made it so they can't set a range higher than 12 or lower than -12. -Gav
[5.109] -- Snipers now add straight to the text file, since any admin is allowed to add snipers.  Removing snipers removes from the text file.  Same for litesnipers and removing them.  Added commands addsnipertemp() and addlitesnipertemp() which adds people only to the hashes and not the text files, respective to each type of sniper. -Gav
[5.110] -- bugfix in vsniper and tree stuff -gav
[5.111] -- first version of stencil brush done and about to be tested privately. -gav
[5.112] -- Stencil working for single pastes and saves. - Gav
[5.113] -- Added stencil list brush - pastes random stencils from list files with optional random rotations. -Gav
[5.114] -- Giltwist didn't check for NPE when making the Slime Ball the 1Click Delete tool -- prz
[5.115] -- More 'things' .. -- prz
[5.116] -- Fixed undo error caused when undoing an empty undo. The culprit here is some brush(es) that doesn't check whether the undo is empty before adding it to undo list -- prz
[5.117] -- Fixed loophole for litesnipers to use any size brush. -Gav
[5.118] -- Fixed ANOTHER loophole with erosion brush to do the same thing.  Also fixed /b so it actually gives you your previous brush with all settings.  Began work on fixing up the records.  They should be fixed (but records not turned on yet).  ALSO presets should work, so /bms 5 will save you brush #5 which you can load /bml 5 later. Currently resets at reload. Will go in later and make it so that it saves an actual file for each sniper with their presets. -GJ
[5.119] -- Disabled Underlay brushes GunPowder code to prevent errors -jmck95
[5.120] -- Updated All the Events and net.minecraft.setver-using classes for Minecraft&Bukkit 1.1 -- prz
[5.121] -- lots of work on brush presets, not functional yet, but can be merged.  Can anybody explain why in vSniper, ((Brush)(myBrushes.get("Disc")) instanceof Brush) would possibly return false, yet not throw any casting errors? -gav -- Yes, if the brush wasn't instantiated and thus returned null -psa
[5.122] -- Made triangle brush idiot proof for lites, and gave it to them (max side length of 40), and also raised block limits on copypasta which were too low. -Gav
[5.123] -- Cleaned up brush enums -psa
[5.124] -- throttle attempt, voxel brush only -gav
[5.125] -- Maintenence: clamping max y placement at the world max height and the min y placement at y=0; Also prepared VS for 1.2 (built and ran in 1.2) -psa
[5.126] -- Added multi-command sends e.g. "/v 50| /b b mm| /vr 8" -psa
[5.127] -- Update HitBlox.java to account for new World heigth -prz PS: Change 5.126 does not work as advertised. "/v 50 \\|/b b mm \\| /vr 8" is what is required. The previous system required: "/v 50/b b mm/vr 8" I really don't understand the logic behind this change. -prz
[5.128] -- vchunk and /b lc should be 1.2 ready - Gilt
[5.129] -- Updated, yet again, the usage of the constructor of Packet51MapChunk.java to craftbukkit-1.2.3-R0.2 -prz
[5.130] -- Removed unused imports, self-assigned variables, other warnings -psa @prz: That's regex. "\\|" in Java regex is "|". Furthermore, I added the "|" split to A) match Mumfrey's macro mod and B) remove potential confusion about demonstrating commands e.g. "/m person do /spawn". -- Sorry, I wrote that before you fixed it, but committed it after, before I knew that you fixed it. -prz
[5.131] -- Fully compatible with 1.2 (added redstone lamps and changed the deprecated CreatureType to EntityType in the Monster brush) -psa
[5.133] -- Added Jungle tree type + mushrooms, fixed trees not being able to spawn above 126 -butters
